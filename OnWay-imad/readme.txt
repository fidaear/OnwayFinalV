Hi Teacher, i hope you are doing well to start our project OnWay you have to follow those instructions:

first you will need to start local development server using this command : php artisan serve

if you face an error please run this command : composer update & php artisan serve

secondly : we are using building tool Vite so you will need  to run : npm install & npm run dev

then we prepared a fake data to interact with so you will need to run this command : php artisan db:seed

and that's it thank you for this amazing journey 

OnWay Group :)
